```

## Customizing Password Policy

The password policy can be customized by editing the `config/policy.yml` file:

```yaml
password_policy:
  min_length: 12 # Minimum password length
  require_upper: true # Require uppercase letters
  require_lower: true # Require lowercase letters
  require_digits: true # Require numbers
  require_special: true # Require special characters
  max_breach_count: 0 # Maximum allowed breach occurrences
  min_entropy: 60 # Minimum required entropy (bits)
  special_chars: '!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>' # Allowed special characters
```

The default policy requires passwords to:

- Be at least 12 characters long
- Contain uppercase and lowercase letters
- Include at least one digit and one special character
- Have a minimum entropy of 60 bits
- Not appear in any known data breaches

## Training the ML Model

The application uses a machine learning model to predict password strength. To train or retrain the model:

1. Obtain a password dataset (e.g., RockYou.txt)
2. Place the dataset in the `data/` directory
3. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

The training process:

- Loads weak passwords from the dataset
- Generates strong password examples based on policy requirements
- Creates "tricky" weak passwords that might look strong
- Extracts features using TF-IDF vectorization
- Trains a Logistic Regression classifier
- Saves the model and vectorizer to the `models/` directory

The model uses character n-grams (2-5) as features to capture important password patterns and is trained with balanced class weights to handle dataset imbalance.

## Advanced Features

### Entropy Calculation

The application calculates password entropy based on character set diversity and length:

```
Entropy = Length Ã— logâ‚‚(Character Set Size)
```

Where Character Set Size is determined by the types of characters used (lowercase, uppercase, digits, special). This provides a quantitative measure of password strength based on information theory.

### Breach Checking

The application uses the HaveIBeenPwned API's k-anonymity model to check if passwords have appeared in known data breaches:

1. The password is hashed using SHA-1
2. Only the first 5 characters of the hash are sent to the API
3. The API returns all matching hashes with those 5 characters
4. The application checks locally if the full hash is in the response

This approach ensures passwords are never sent in full to the service, preserving security.

### AI-Powered Feedback

The application uses the Ollama implementation of the llama3.2 model to analyze password characteristics and generate natural language feedback explaining:

- Overall security assessment
- Specific weaknesses identified
- Actionable recommendations for improvement

The AI model is run locally for enhanced privacy and processes only the analysis results, not the raw password.

### Password Generation Strategies

The application employs multiple strategies for password generation:

1. **Complex Random Generation**: Creates high-entropy passwords using secure random functions
2. **Enhanced User Password**: Applies L33tspeak substitutions and strategic additions to user passwords
3. **Transformed Passwords**: Starts with a base template and applies transformations
4. **AI-Enhanced**: Uses AI to intelligently modify the user's password while preserving recognizable elements

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Privacy**: This application never sends plaintext passwords to external services. Breach checking uses the k-anonymity model of the HaveIBeenPwned API.

2. **Password Storage**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with a secure work factor (12 by default). In a production environment, these would be sent to a backend system.

3. **Transformer Models**: The application uses Ollama for AI features, which processes data locally. The models are stored in a configurable directory (default: "F:\\Projects\\ollama_models").

4. **Demo Mode**: Some features may display sensitive information for demonstration purposes. Modify for production use.

## Development and Customization

### Adding New Pattern Detection

To add additional pattern detection rules, modify the `password_analyzer.py` file:

1. Add new pattern detection methods
2. Include new regex patterns in the `common_patterns` list
3. Update the `analyze_password` method to include your new detection

### Extending AI Capabilities

To enhance AI features:

1. Replace the default Ollama model by changing the `DEFAULT_MODEL` in `ai_explainer.py`
2. Customize prompt templates in the `generate_feedback` and `enhance_password` methods
3. Consider adding more advanced AI features by extending the `AIExplainer` class

### Adjusting Security Thresholds

To modify security thresholds:

1. Edit the `policy.yml` file to change minimum requirements
2. Adjust the `SecurityEstimator` class in `advanced_analyzer.py` to update crack time estimates
3. Modify the `PasswordGenerator` to align with new policy requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model Loading Errors**:

   - Ensure the ML model is trained using `train_model.py`
   - Check that the model files exist in the `models/` directory

2. **Ollama Issues**:

   - Verify Ollama is installed (https://ollama.com/)
   - Check the model path in `ai_explainer.py`
   - Consider using a different model if the default is unavailable

3. **API Connection Failures**:
   - Ensure internet connectivity for breach checking
   - Consider implementing a fallback when the API is unreachable.
