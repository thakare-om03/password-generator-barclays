## Customizing Password Policy

The password policy can be customized by editing the `config/policy.yml` file:

```yaml
password_policy:
  min_length: 12                 # Minimum password length
  require_upper: true            # Require uppercase letters
  require_lower: true            # Require lowercase letters
  require_digits: true           # Require numbers
  require_special: true          # Require special characters
  max_breach_count: 0            # Maximum allowed breach occurrences
  min_entropy: 60                # Minimum required entropy (bits)
  special_chars: '!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>'  # Allowed special characters
```

## Training the ML Model

The application includes a machine learning model to predict password strength. To train the model:

1. Obtain a password dataset (e.g., RockYou.txt)
2. Place the dataset in the `data/` directory
3. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

The script will:
- Load weak passwords from the dataset
- Generate strong password examples based on policy requirements
- Create "tricky" weak passwords that might look strong
- Extract features using TF-IDF vectorization
- Train a Logistic Regression classifier
- Save the model and vectorizer to the `models/` directory

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Privacy**: This application never sends plaintext passwords to external services. Breach checking uses the k-anonymity model of the HaveIBeenPwned API.

2. **Password Storage**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with a secure work factor. In a production environment, these would be sent to a backend system.

3. **Transformer Models**: The application uses transformer models for AI features, which may transfer data to GPU memory. Ensure your environment meets security requirements.

4. **Demo Mode**: Some features may display sensitive information for demonstration purposes. Modify for production use.

## Advanced Features

### Entropy Calculation

The application calculates password entropy based on character set diversity and length, providing a quantitative measure of password strength.

### Breach Checking

The application checks if passwords have appeared in known data breaches using the HaveIBeenPwned API's k-anonymity model, which ensures passwords are never sent in full to the service.

### AI-Powered Feedback

The application uses transformer models to analyze password characteristics and generate natural language feedback explaining:
- Overall security assessment
- Specific weaknesses identified
- Actionable recommendations for improvement
